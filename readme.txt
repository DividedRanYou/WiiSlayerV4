By modifying KoreanKii we were able to remove all user input and text so it would instantly execute the program and assuming the Wii isn't Korean this will most likely brick the user's Wii.

We added a C script that then displays an image called image.png which you can replace we did this so modifying the banner would be easy without changing the code.

I then realised that the user might have alot of there saves on there SD card or USB stick so i added a script to be executed right after the bricking to erase all files from both storage devices and wipe them clean.

The whole of the dev team then remembered PriiLoader and BootMii which can prevent this from happening so that's something we need to erase as well, we are stilling working to do that.
